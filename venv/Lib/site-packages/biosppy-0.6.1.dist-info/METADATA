# BioSPPy - Biosignal Processing in Python

*A toolbox for biosignal processing written in Python.*

[![Image](https://github.com/PIA-Group/BioSPPy/raw/master/docs/logo/logo_400.png "I know you're listening! - xkcd.com/525")](http://biosppy.readthedocs.org/)

The toolbox bundles together various signal processing and pattern recognition
methods geared towards the analysis of biosignals.

Highlights:

- Support for various biosignals: BVP, ECG, EDA, EEG, EMG, Respiration
- Signal analysis primitives: filtering, frequency analysis
- Clustering
- Biometrics

Documentation can be found at: <http://biosppy.readthedocs.org/>

## Installation

Installation can be easily done with `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install biosppy
```

## Simple Example

The code below loads an ECG signal from the `examples` folder, filters it,
performs R-peak detection, and computes the instantaneous heart rate.

```python
from biosppy import storage
from biosppy.signals import ecg

# load raw ECG signal
signal, mdata = storage.load_txt('./examples/ecg.txt')

# process it and plot
out = ecg.ecg(signal=signal, sampling_rate=1000., show=True)
```

This should produce a plot similar to the one below.
